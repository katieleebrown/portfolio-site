# My Portfolio
This is the most up-to-date version of my portfolio. It includes links to a few of my recent projects, some information about me and freelancing opportunities, as well as a contact section. You can take a look at the live version of my portfolio, here: https://katieleebrown.netlify.app/

# How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript

The base of this project was made with a template. As I'm a web developer and not a designer, I wanted to make sure my portfolio looked as professional as possible, and HTML5 is an awesome site with free templates that you can customize to fit your needs. I've made updates to the inital code to keep my portfolio simple, add a few components, and update form sections. 

# Optimizations
This site included quite a few minor tweaks to really keep the look of the page consistent. Image sizes were streamlined and fonts were updated, but my biggest addition was an update to the menu that was also mobile friendly. 

# Lessons Learned
This was my first time using a template and to be honest with you, templates are SUPER helpful. In past projects I'd spent too much time getting caught up in the look of a project that I was creating, instead of just doing what I do best. This project really helped me realize how to best find and use tools to make my job easier while working to get my site up and running to start freelancing, and I was able to do just that!
